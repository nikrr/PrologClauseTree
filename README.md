# PrologClauseTree
Prolog program clause tree visualizer

Use the output of trace. as input (not colored) from "trace.txt", ignore lines that do not start with whitespaces. Stop at first empty line. Print program clause tree into "out.txt". Please take into account that by default, trace output indents the steps with 4 spaces, my algorithm will only recognize lines formatted that way.
