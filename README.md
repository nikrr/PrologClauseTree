# PrologClauseTree
Prolog program clause tree visualizer

Uses the output of trace. as input (uncolored) from "trace.txt", ignoring lines that do not start with whitespaces. Stops at the first completely empty line. Prints the program clause tree into "out.txt". Please take into account that by default, trace's output indents the steps with 4 spaces, my algorithm will only recognize lines formatted that way.
